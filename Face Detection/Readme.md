## Easy way of detecting faces using Haar cascades in OpenCV and Python.

Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. Today we will be using the face classifier. You can experiment with other classifiers as well.

- We can detect faces in videos and from images.
